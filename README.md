# GCSE Insights: 2019-20 Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis of the 2019-20 GCSE results for English and Maths. We aim to uncover the factors affecting student performance and predict outcomes using linear regression.

## Features
- Data preprocessing scripts for cleaning and formatting the raw CSV dataset.
- Exploratory data analysis notebooks with visualizations of score distributions and demographic correlations.
- Feature engineering and selection code to prepare the dataset for machine learning.
- A linear regression model training and evaluation pipeline.

## Results
The model achieved a moderate level of accuracy, indicating the complex nature of educational performance. The findings point to specific demographic factors that correlate with GCSE outcomes.

## Usage
Instructions for setting up the environment, running the analysis, and interpreting the results are provided. Jupyter Notebooks guide you through each step of the process.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions from educators, data scientists, and enthusiasts. Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on how to contribute to this project.
